* I'm very interested in marine life, even had a salt water tank in the past
* I enjoy working with anything computers but have not decided on a specific field to pursue
* Play videogames a lot, primarily, osu! and Valorant

## Technical Background

I'm relavtively new to the field as I was focused on Radiology until right before freshman year of college. Therefore, I have a CIS 163 understanding of Java. I will also be learning C for a class this semester.
